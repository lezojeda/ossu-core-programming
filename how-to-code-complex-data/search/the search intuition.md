problems like the sudoku, or maze are solvable via a function that tackles three key aspects:

1. **Generating** (see generative recursion)
2. an **arbitrary arity-tree** (see binary trees from how to code simple data)
3. and doing **backtracking search** over it

we generate x mazes or possible sudokus, keep generating until we reach one that is invalid and then go back
