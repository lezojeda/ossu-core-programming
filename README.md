# OSSU Core Programming
Notes and solutions to exercises and problems from the [Core Programming](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#core-programming) curriculum section
## Systematic Program Design
### [How to code simple data](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-core-cs/tree/main/how-to-code-simple-data)
### [How to code complex data](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-core-cs/tree/main/how-to-code-complex-data)
## Programming Languages
This three-part course consists of an exploration of SML, Racket and Ruby. Two functional languages and one object-oriented one. Why these three?

They form a **useful combination** of dynamically/statically typed and one OO (Ruby) vs two functional (Racket and SML).

|                     | dynamically typed | statically typed |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **functional**      | Racket            | SML              |
| **object-oriented** | Ruby              | Java/C#/Scala    |
