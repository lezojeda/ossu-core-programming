define-struct goes at the beginning of the data definition, before the types comment.

```racket
(define-struct ball (x y))
;; Ball is (make-ball Number Number)
;; interp. a ball at position x, y 

(define BALL-1 (make-ball 6 10))

#;
(define (fn-for-ball b)
  (... (ball-x b)     ;Number
       (ball-y b)))   ;Number
;; Template rules used:
;;  - compound: 2 fields
```
