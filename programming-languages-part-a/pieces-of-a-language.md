## 1. syntax
how do you write language constructs?
## 2. semantics*
what do programs means? (evaluation rules)
## 3. idioms*
what are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation?
## 4. libraries
what facilities does the language provide "standard"? e.g. file access, data strutures
## 5. tools
what do language implementations provide to make your job easier? e.g. REPL debugger code formatter
## focus
the focus of the course it is on **semantics** and **idioms**

**syntax** is usually uninteresting, just facts to learn

**libraries** and **tools** are learnt on the job
