# errors
where could a mistake be?
1. **syntax**: what is written means nothing or not the construct intended
2. **type-checking**: what is written does not typecheck
3. **evaluation**: runs but produces wrong answer, exception or infinite loop

it's important to *always* have this in mind when debugging error programs
